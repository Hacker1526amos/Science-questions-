                    In 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787-1854) found out the relationship 
                    between tghe current I, flowing inmetallic wire and the potential difference across its terminals. He stated that the electric current flowing through 
                    a metallic wire is directly propostional to the potential difference V, across its ends provided its temperture remains the same.
                    <br>
                    The resistance of a circuit is defined as the ratio between the voltage applied to
                    the current flowing through it. Rearranging the above relation,
                    <br>

                    Electric charge flow easily through some materials than others. The electrical 
                    resistance measures how much the flow of this electric charge is restricted within the circuit.
